BilgeSolverSimulator
====================

Multithreaded optimized bruteforce solver for the Puzzle Pirates Bilge Puzzle.

To use: There's a couple source files. Just build them in some sort of C++ project (make sure to target Windows since we use Window's API for image recognition and Mouse-Movement.

#Features:

Game-winning performance: The algorithm is best. It will get full-ultimate on 3 depth, #1 on 4 depth.

Speed: Fully threaded meaning your 4 depth will likely take much less time than any other implementation.

Multiclient Support: Only requires windows to be visible on the main monitor for piece recognition. It will do the work of balancing moves between them for you.

#TODO:
- Add some more robustness.
